Had this amazing Product Hackathon by Nailit . Built a deck proposal for Notion on pointing their bugs, how vendors 
like GenAI and LLM architecture models can help out Notion in building better experience for users. 
We as a team of 4 drafted out various feature enhancements that Notion could work on that will definitely give them 4x growth in user retention by our research.
